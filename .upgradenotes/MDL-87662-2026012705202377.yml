notes:
  theme:
    - message: >-
        The manual completion button and activity dates have been moved
        to the activity header to improve visibility and proximity to the
        activity name. A new theme layout option, `activityinfoinheader`,
        has been introduced to control this behaviour and is enabled by
        default. Themes that set `activityinfoinheader` to false must
        manually override the relevant template (such as `activity_header`
        or `activity_info`) to ensure the completion information and the
        activity dates are displayed correctly.
