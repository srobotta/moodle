  core_question:
    - message: >-
        During restore of a question_set_reference, mapping of IDs in the
        filtercondition is now delegated to qbank plugins.
        If your qbank plugin defines a filter condition that uses database
        IDs, add an override of `restore_filtercondition()` to the `condition`
        class, which checks the condition's data and replaces the IDs with
        mapped values if required. See 
        `qbank_managecategories\category_condition` for an example.
